# Big Data Analysis Final Project

## The majority of this repository contains scripts used to analize eDNA sequences in QIIME2 via the command line
I used an HPC available to me to load QIIME2 using the commands
```
interactive
module load QIIME2.2019.7
nano nameofscript.sh
bash /path/to/script
```
The sequences analyzed are eDNA samples collected from 24 locations around Narragansett Bay.
For this analysis, I looked at a subset to 10 samples from 4 locations.
All scripts were run in the folder location containing fastq.gz files for all the samples used.
