## Research Question:  Will eDNA sampling accurately measure vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity in Narragansett Bay?
* for this analysis we will be looking at a subset of 10 samples from 4 locations

## Methods
### Collection of data
Sample collection took place across 24 locations around Narragansett Bay. Samples were collected during four seasons over the span of two years. To include a more robust sampling model, four replicates per sample were collected. Conditions throughout Narragansett Bay vary due to differences in freshwater input and human population density. This sampling scheme is designed to include locations that have varied dissolved oxygen, salinity, and nitrogen levels. Keeping this in mind, this sampling data will be used to assess biodiversity levels across Narragansett Bay.

At each sampling location, water was collected in four 1-liter samples of water for a total of 768 samples. Each of the water samples were filtered through glass sterile 1 Î¼m filters (GF, borosilicate glass) and DNA was extracted from each of these filters using a Qiagen DNeasy kit. Three amplicons of each sample were generated using the primer TELE02. This primer is specifically developed for fish eDNA metabarcoding of fresh and saltwater fish. Samples were then sequenced by an Illumina MiSeq to computationally identify species.
