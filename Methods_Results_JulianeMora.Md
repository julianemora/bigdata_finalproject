## Research Question: How do you explore DNA sequence data in QIIME2?
* for this analysis we will be looking at a subset of 10 samples from 4 locations

## Methods
### Importing raw sequence files into QIIME2

### Creating a metadata file

### Creating a summary of demultiplexed Sequences

### Denoising sequences

### Creating visualizations

## Results
### Viewing visualizations in QIIME2view

### Implications of visualizations
